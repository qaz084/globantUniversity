Welcome to the repository dedicated to the Test Automation course at Globant University. This course offers a comprehensive collection of exercises and practices designed to enhance your skills in the field of Test Automation. Throughout the course, participants engage in collaborative problem-solving, working in pairs to tackle a variety of challenges.

Here's an overview of what we covered in this extensive program:

Algorithmic Problem Solving: We delved into algorithmic thinking using pseudo-code, laying a strong foundation for problem-solving strategies.

Java Programming with Object-Oriented Paradigm: We explored Java programming, emphasizing the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. We applied the principles of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations to solve diverse challenges.

Unit Testing with JUnit: Participants learned how to implement effective unit testing using JUnit, ensuring the reliability and correctness of their code.

Version Control with Git: Understanding the importance of version control, we mastered Git, enabling seamless collaboration and efficient management of code changes.

Automation with Jenkins: We automated various tasks using Jenkins, linking our repositories and triggering specific actions whenever updates occurred. This automation streamlined our workflow and enhanced efficiency.

Throughout this course, we progressed from fundamental concepts to complex problem-solving techniques. The primary programming language utilized was Java, supplemented by the Maven build automation tool, which facilitated the management of project dependencies and build processes.
